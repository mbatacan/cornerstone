This is the front page of your project documentation!

The Standards team has designed this documentation template to help you abide by CAO's documentation best practices. On each tab we have outlined the materials we expect each project to have documented, from EDA to end-user outputs. This template is designed to be a living piece of documentation, regularly updated with all new and relevent project information.

This page serves as your project overview, and requires the following documentation information:

- Describe customer business objectives/issues and briefly outline how the project will work to address and solve it
- Define project evaluation metrics

NOTE:
On this page and all other documentation pages included for your project within this template please delete all the instructions written by the standards team and replace with your own project documentation. If you ever want to reference the documentation requirements they are included on the carrot documentation page. Reach out to Ben Thomas from the Standards team if any issues arise.
